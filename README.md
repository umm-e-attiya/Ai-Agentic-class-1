# Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an instruction-based AI agent using Gemini API (OpenAI-compatible) with Python. It includes secure API management using .env, dependency management with UV, and integration of the openai-agents package to build custom agent behavior.

# Features
🔐 API key stored securely using .env

⚙️ Dependency management with UV

🤖 Custom agent setup using openai-agents

🧪 Instruction-tuning for agent behavior

🛡️ .env added to .gitignore to prevent exposure

# Requirements
Python 3.8+

UV package manager

Gemini API Key (from Google AI Studio)
